## 1.3.0

- :rocket: Updated to MaterialUi v4.9.11
- :rocket: Colors are now zero cost bindings
- :rocket: Added the `<Box />` component
- :rocket: Added the `MaterialUi.Core` module. Some examples:
  - ```
    useTheme() => MaterialUi.Theme.t
    ```
  - ```ml
    useMediaQueryString("(min-width:600px)") => bool
    ```
  - ```ml
    useMediaQuery(MaterialUi.Core.Breakpoint.get(theme,`up(`sm))) => bool
    ```

- :house: Some fixes in component inheritance to delete some props that are not documented on certain components
- :boom: Accessing of colors now via record definition, not in separate modules anymore
- :boom: `Grid` sizes are prefixed by a `\`` now due to the enum optimizations
- :boom: `{sz}Auto` props are removed from `Grid`, as you can now use the prop directly (e.g. `<Grid md=\`Auto />`, or`<Grid md=\`False />`)
